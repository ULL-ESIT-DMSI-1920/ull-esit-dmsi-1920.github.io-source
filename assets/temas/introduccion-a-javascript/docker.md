## Sample Application

For the rest of this tutorial, we will be working with a simple todo list manager that is running in Node.js. If you’re not familiar with Node.js, don’t worry. No real JavaScript experience is needed.

## Node.js Docker Tutorial 

The Node.js getting started guide teaches you how to create a containerized Node.js application using Docker. In this guide, you’ll learn how to:

* Create a simple Node.js application
* Create a new Dockerfile which contains instructions required to build a Node.js image
* Run the newly built image as a container
* Set up a local development environment to connect a database to the container
* Use Docker Compose to run the Node.js application
* Configure a CI/CD pipeline for your application using GitHub Actions.
* After completing the Node.js getting started modules, you should be able to containerize your own Node.js application based on the examples and instructions provided in this guide.
